:
	C Programming Tokens

When the preprocessor lexical convension is done the program is then reduce 
to sequence of tokens.

	There are six class of tokens .

1) Identifier
2) keyword
3) constant
4) operators
5) string literals
6) seperators (collective of white space) newline, vertical/horizontal tab, feedform ( ASCII TABLE  )


			FIRST TOKEN OF C LANGUAGE

		IDENTIFIER
	
	What's identifier?

 Identifier is a name you give to :
1) function
2) variable
3) pointers
4) arrays

 JAVASCRIPT :  var number;
 PHP	    :  $pen
 C/C++	    : int age;

	Simple prototype of variable is
		eg : datatype identifier

memory 	address can be 0x13231adf343
 

They're identifiers already taken by the language itself.


				SECOND TOKEN

			KEYWORDS

	What's keyword?
Keyword are special identifier used by C language to perform special
system taskes.

	How many keywords are there in C language?

They're 32 keyword in C language.

auto, break, continue, static, typedef, volatile, enum, extern, int,
float, char, double, struct, switch, case, default, for, while, do,
if, else, elif, const, union, sizeof, long, void, signed, unsigned,
return, goto, short

	
			THIRD TOKEN
		CONSTANT

	What's constant?
Constants are define global or local variables that doesn't change it 
value even when being called.

	How're constants defined?
 first : using the macro substitution and must be in upper case letter
	eg: #define NUM	100

 second : using the keyword call ( const ), UPPER OR LOWER case letter
	eg: const int x = 1000;  or int const x = 100;
	eg: const int X = 500;  or int const X = 200;

	Types of constants using ( const ) keyword.	
	1 ) character constant	 | const char ch = 'b';  | char const ch = 'c';
	2 ) integer constant  	 | const int i = 0;      | int const i = 2;
	3 ) enumeration constant | const enum { ... };   | enum const { ... };
	4 ) float constant	 | const float pi = 3.14;| float const pi = 2.5;


				FOUR TOKEN

			OPERATORS
	
	What's operator?

 Operator are way in which computer perform arithmetic and logic unit.

 NOTE:
 	Operators in C language uses what is called :
		Evaluation of precedence

	eg : SYMBOLS 	() {} , . -> # % & && | || ; = ==

	OPERATORS				ASSOCIATIVITY

	() [] -> .				left to right
!  ~  ++  --  +  -  *  &  (type)  sizeof	right to left
       *  /  %					left to right
       +  -					left to right
       <<  >>   				left to right
   <  <=  >  >=					left to right
      ==   !=					left to right
         &					left to right
	 ^					left to right
	 |					left to right
	 &&					left to right
	 ||					left to right
	 ?:					right to left
=  +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  &=  ^=  |=  <<=  >>=     right to left
         ,					left to right


BINARY :
	AND LOGICAL, way which computer can check for conditons
		
	0	0 	0
	1	0	0
	0	1	0
	1	1	1

BINARY :
	OR LOGICAL, way which computer can check for conditions
	
	0	0	0
	1	0	1
	0	1	1
	1	1	1

	

 BODMAS :
	B = bracket
	O = of
	D = division
	M = multiplication
	A = addition
	s = substraction

	eg : [ 7 x 4 ] / 2 x  [ 4 + 5 ] - 8
		28 / 2 x 9 - 8
   		14 x 9 - 8
		126 - 8
		118	


				FIFTH TOKEN

			STRING LITERALS

	What's string literal?

 String literal are set of characters encoded in double quote ( " " ).
	
	NOTE : There is no such thing has string keyword in C language

		eg : char ch = 'f';

	There're two ways to represent a string in c language.
		Those two ways is using DATA STRUCTURE

	1 ) using arrays :
		char arr[] = "pls follow, like and share my videos \n";

	2 ) using a pointer :
		char *ptr = "pls follow, like and share my videos \0";

				SIXTH TOKEN

		SEPERATOR

	What's seperator?

Seperators are ascii or unicode printable and non-printable charset.

	How can you view the ascii?
		1 ) by using the internet.
		2 ) by using the linux terminal


		TOOLS WE NEED TO START WRITING C CODE

 1 ) Compiler   : gcc,   clang,    cc
 2 ) editor 	: vim,	 nano,   pico,	emac 
 3 ) Gdb	: gun gdb debugger
 4 ) Makefile	: make program
 5 ) Git	: gnu git
